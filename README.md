# Drive 45 App
This was an mobile app that I created along with Jesse Bullard for Deep Run's Driver's Education course. The app allows students to log their driving times and export the time via email. The app was created using React Native, a Javascript framework for creating mobile apps and Expo, a platform for creating Android and iOS apps. The app can be downloaded onto an Android device through an apk file, or used online as a Progressive Web App.
